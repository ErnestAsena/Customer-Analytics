# Customer-Analytics
## Analysis and Clustering  of Customers and Predicting Customer Behaviour

For this project, I performed a cluster analysis on customers 
with K-Means and used Principal Component Analysis for
Dimensionality Reduction.

In the second notebook, I perform a deep learning neural net to predict
customer conversion.
